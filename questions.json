His work focuses on how we think about and create visual representatiosn of complex information. He is a primary advocate for minimalist design, focusing on data-ink ratio and chartjunk. He also talks about the lie factor, the importance of accuracy of visualzing data, a measure of how much a graphic disorts the data it is meant to represent.
